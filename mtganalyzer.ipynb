    "# An Analysis of Magic: The Gathering's Creatures\n",
    "Welcome to Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game produced by Wizards of the Coast where each player pretends to be a wizard casting spells and summoning creatures to reduce their opponent's life points from 20 to 0. This game has been out since 1993, and has changed dramatically since then, with the game increasing in power level and complexity over its 30 years of existence. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vocabulary\n",
    "Throughout the analysis I will use several Magic: the Gathering specific terms. While it is not necessary to have played magic to understand this analysis, the following definition will certainly be helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Mana: The elemental magic used to cast spells, which is generated from land cards. Each card has its own mana cost, which denotes the amount and type of mana that it requires. There are five types of mana: green (G), white (W), black (B), blue (U), and red (R), each with their own types of spells they like to cast. \"CMC\" refers to \"Converted Mana Cost\", or how much total mana it costs to cast the spell.\n",
    "  2. Set: Magic cards are released periodically in groups called \"sets\" which contain a few hundred magic cards each.\n",
    "  3. Type: Each card has a different type; for the purpose of this analysis, we will be focusing on creatures.\n",
    "  4. Creature: Creatures represent minions you can summon to help you fight your opponent. Each creature has a mana cost, a power (its strength), a toughness (its health), a few types (like Human, Elf, Dragon, etc.), and its abilities. A creature with power X and toughness Y is called as \"an X/Y creature\".\n",
    "  5. Keyword: Some abilities of creatures are common enough across sets that they get their own keyword. This is just an easy way for players to denote some abilities.\n",
    "  6. Ability: Most creatures (not all!) have abilities that can be activated or are always in effect. Some creatures have no abilities, which are called vanilla creatures; some creatures only have keyworded abilities, which are called \"french vanilla\" creatures."

    "The data we will use is from [scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), a community-ran magic the gathering site. Scryfall's data is often more reliable and accurate than the data that Wizards produces, and it is also freely available for download through their API. This data contains every single card in Magic's history that was printed in English - 78,242 card objects. However, many of these objects are extraneous and would hurt our data analysis. For the next section, I will prune down these cards to exclude reprinted cards, illegal cards, joke cards, and many other types of cards that have been created over the years."

    "Now let's try to predict the mana cost of the creature based on the data we have. First, let's drop all unnecessary data and get just the good stuff into a `data_df`. This will contain all the variables with which we will predict Converted Mana Cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to predict the Converted Mana Cost of a creature based just on its vanilla stats. These stats include its power, toughness, color, rarity, release date, number of colored pips, and number of colors. My predictions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. A point of power will cost more than a point of toughness, as there are many cheap creatures such as Walls which are good at defending but poor at attacking.\n",
    " 2. The color will have some influence; Green creatures will be the cheapest, and probably Blue creatures will incur some mana cost penalty, but I'm not sure where the other colors will be in between.\n",
    " 3. Rarity will have a large influence, especially on vanilla creatures; rare vanilla creatures will be much less expensive than common ones. \n",
    " 4. Release date will have some influence, as newer cards are generally considered more powerful than older cards.\n",
    " 5. Number of colored pips and number of colors may not matter much for vanilla creatures as most vanilla creatures are one color and very low colored pips. However, they might come up with a bigger effect in later analyses."

One-hot encoding means that instead of having a single rarity column with values \"common\" and \"uncommon\", we now have two rarity columns, \"rarity_common\" and \"rarity_uncommon\", which contain integer values which are 0 if the card is rare and 1 if the card is uncommon. We will do the same thing for colors -- note that a card can have multiple colors, so there could be multiple `colors_` columns that have a 1 in them for a given card.\n",
