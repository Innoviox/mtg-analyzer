    "# An Analysis of Magic: The Gathering's Creatures\n",
    "Welcome to Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game produced by Wizards of the Coast where each player pretends to be a wizard casting spells and summoning creatures to reduce their opponent's life points from 20 to 0. This game has been out since 1993, and has changed dramatically since then, with the game increasing in power level and complexity over its 30 years of existence. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vocabulary\n",
    "Throughout the analysis I will use several Magic: the Gathering specific terms. While it is not necessary to have played magic to understand this analysis, the following definition will certainly be helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Mana: The elemental magic used to cast spells, which is generated from land cards. Each card has its own mana cost, which denotes the amount and type of mana that it requires. There are five types of mana: green (G), white (W), black (B), blue (U), and red (R), each with their own types of spells they like to cast. \n",
    "  2. Set: Magic cards are released periodically in groups called \"sets\" which contain a few hundred magic cards each.\n",
    "  3. Type: Each card has a different type; for the purpose of this analysis, we will be focusing on creatures. Creatures represent minions you can summon to help you fight your opponent. Each creature has a mana cost, a power (its strength), a toughness (its health), a few types (like Human, Elf, Dragon, etc.), and its abilities. \n",

    "The data we will use is from [scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), a community-ran magic the gathering site. Scryfall's data is often more reliable and accurate than the data that Wizards produces, and it is also freely available for download through their API. This data contains every single card in Magic's history that was printed in English - 78,242 card objects. However, many of these objects are extraneous and would hurt our data analysis. For the next section, I will prune down these cards to exclude reprinted cards, illegal cards, joke cards, and many other types of cards that have been created over the years."
